# NFTracker
## Overview
This program will read collection names from a txt file and output the stats into an excel spreadsheet with each collection as a different sheet in the workbook.
## Setup
The setup of this project is relativly easy, make sure that you have python installed and then just run the run.bat file.
## Configuration
Place the names of collections in the collections.txt file **NOTE:** the names of the collections must be the names that appear in the url on OpenSea website. For example, https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub is the URL for Bored Ape Yacht Club, therefore the name in the collections.txt would be everything after the last '/' (boredapeyachtclub). 
### Thanks to Opensea for providing the API
